multicloudhub-repo is intended to serve charts for the [multicloudhub-operator installer](https://github.com/open-cluster-management/multicloudhub-operator)

## Updating charts in the `multiclusterhub/charts` folder (as of 3/10/20)

*NOTE: This requires the Helm 3 CLI*

Calling the cloner script will build all the charts from the master branch and generate an index
```console
bash cloner.sh
```
